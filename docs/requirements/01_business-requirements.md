# Business Requirements (AI-optimized)

## 1. Objective

Develop a web application that displays a ranked list of personal computers (PCs) that are available for purchase on Amazon.  
The ranking is based on internal logic that evaluates each product for suitability in specific use cases (e.g., video streaming, office work).  
The goal is to help non-technical users select the best PC without needing deep technical knowledge.

## 2. Scope (First Release)

- Target data source: Amazon product listings only
- Display only: no search, filter, or comparison features
- Focus on clear, minimal UI for low-tech users
- Rankings generated automatically based on predefined logic
- Include low-priced or uncommon models not typically featured on commercial comparison sites
- Only essential product information (name, release date, price, use-case suitability score) is displayed

## 3. Target Users

- Non-technical general users seeking to buy a PC from Amazon
- Users who want a PC optimized for a particular use case (e.g., streaming, basic tasks)
- Users who struggle to find suitable products via standard search or comparison methods
